Garmin File Manager
--------------------------

An application using Grails, Backbone, Marionette and MongoDB to help manage and split garmin files by laps and time gaps for those of us who accidentally forget to stop our timers.  I used to do
this by hand, but thought making an application to help would be a much simpler solution.
